    <p>There are many reasons why I'm making this Webpage:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>To show I can</li>
        <li>To get credit for an assignment</li>
        <li>Because It's fun</li>
        <li>Why not?</li>
        <li>To fill up space in a list!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Anyway, here is another block of text so that this webpage doesn't look <em>totally</em> barren. I take pride in my work, you know! Anyway, here's a cool thing I found on the internet: <br><strong>༼つಠ益ಠ༽つ ─=≡ΣO))</strong> <br><em>Isn't that <strong>SO COOL????</strong></em>        It's like a little guy shooting out an energy blast! <em>I</em> think that's pretty cool.

    <p>New paragraph now, because that line was getting too long. Do you want a link? I can give you a link. Oh I can <em>give</em> you a link. Careful what you wish for. <small>I warned you.</small> <a href="CTIS230assignments/LiebkemannAssignment2.html">link</a></p>
